# Focus Timer - Session Save

## 🎯 Current State
**Phase:** 1 (Foundation) - 60% complete  
**Working On:** Sound/haptic notifications on timer completion  
**Last File:** lib/screens/timer_screen.dart  
**Dependencies:** flutter, cupertino_icons

## ✅ Completed
- Phase 1: Basic timer working
  - Timer logic with setState (25min focus/5min break)
  - Start/Pause/Reset controls
  - Circular progress indicator
  - Session counter badge
  - Auto-switching between focus/break
  - Completion dialogs

## 🚧 Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Add sound notifications on completion (audioplayers package)
2. Add haptic feedback
3. Custom duration settings screen
4. Then → migrate to Provider (Phase 2 start)

## 📝 Recent Sessions
**Session 1 (Oct 31, 2025):** 
- Created project structure & living documentation

- Target: Android 21+, iOS 12+
- User has Jetpack Compose/Kotlin background - making Compose parallels in explanations

Phase 2: State Management & Persistence (Provider, Hive, task list)
Phase 3: Advanced State & Navigation (GoRouter, Riverpod, stats)
Phase 4: Backend Integration (Firebase Auth/Firestore/Storage, Dio)
Phase 5: Architecture & Advanced (Clean Architecture, BLoC, deep linking)
